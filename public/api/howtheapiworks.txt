This API folder only contains examples on how the data is structured. 
The data JSON object is on JSONBIN IO website. As experimental for this example.

If you wanna understand or view the structure. Copy the content of such files
and then go to : 
https://jsonviewer.stack.hu/

Then you can understand how the logic is.
